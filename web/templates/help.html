    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Guide to Lila's Transaction History Service</h3>
    <h3>General Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Just put in your wallet address at the top on the homepage, click Generate, and wait to get your report.</li>
        <li>After your report is generated, it will appear on two tabs.  Default view is Tax Report, but you can click on the Transactions tab to see the detailed transaction data.</li>
        <li>An Export CSV button will also appear after generation, clicking it will send you a comma separated data file of the data for the tab you are viewing.</li>
        <li>Change the report options on the left to customize how the report is generated.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Report Options</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Date Range: Only events in this range will be included in the report.  Older transactions will still be searched to look for cost basis.</li>
        <li>Cost Basis: Three options are provided to adjust how cost basis is discovered.  If you are not familiar with these tax accounting related terms, the default choice of First in - First out is most commonly used.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tax Report</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tax reporting requirements vary in different areas, but this report is meant to help you with accounting for things that are commonly required.</li>
        <li>The Capital Gains section will list detected NFT and Token Sales, and attempt to calculate the cost basis/gains for them where possible.</li>
        <li>The Income section will list detected events that are commonly categorized as income like bank interest and rewards.</li>
        <li>The Expenses section will list various costs you have incurred that may be helpful in filling gaps in your cost basis in some situations.</li>
        <li>If you see the warning icon <img src="{{ BASE_SCRIPT_URL }}static/images/alertred.png" /> in the costs column on the tax report, it means that Lila could not find a source for all of the cost basis of that item.  You can find more details in the CSV export to see how much it was partially accounted if any.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The summary tab provides some summarized facts about your transactions.</li>
        <li>These items are just informational curiousities and not necessarily useful for tax accounting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Transaction Report</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The transactions tab summarizes all activity for your wallet including things that are not included in the tax report.</li>
        <li>Heroes: All records related to heroes like buy/sell/hire, summon, and level up.</li>
        <li>Trader: Records of swaps make with trader or vendor in marketplace.</li>
        <li>Liquidity: Records of swapping for LP seeds from the druid, and Entering and Withdrawing from liquidity pools.</li>

        <li>Airdrop: Any Jewel airdrops you have received.</li>
        <li>Quests: All of your rewards from sending heroes on quests.</li>
        <li>Wallet: Any miscellanous transfers to/from your wallet to non-game related addresses.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Price Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fiat Values are calculated based on token price at the end of day when the event happened.</li>
        <li>Prices are sourced from Coin Gecko first if available, otherwise they are looked up from Defi Kingdoms graphql tokenDayData</li>
        <li>For some non-denomination items like some quest rewards, prices may be based on current price if historical price data is empty on the DFK graph.</li>
    </ul>
