    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Lila's Ledger contains helpful transaction history for your wallet across Harmony and Avalanche networks.</h3>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">General Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Just put in your wallet address at the top on the homepage, click Generate, and wait to get your report.</li>
        <li>After your report is generated, it will appear on three tabs.  Default view is Tax Report, but you can click on the Transactions tab to see the detailed transaction data or Summary tab to see other stats about transactions.</li>
        <li>An Export CSV button will also appear after generation, clicking it will send you a comma separated data file of the data for the tab you are viewing.</li>
        <li>Change the report options on the left to customize how the report is generated.</li>
        <li>If you have a lot of transactions, it can take a long time to generate your report, but later reports you run after the first one should run quicker.  At least tax time only comes once a year!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Report Options</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Date Range: Only events in this range will be included in the report.  Older transactions will still be searched to look for cost basis.</li>
        <li>Cost Basis: Three options are provided to adjust how cost basis is discovered.  If you are not familiar with these tax accounting related terms, the default choice of First in - First out is most commonly used.</li>
        <li>CSV Format: Manual option is best if you plan to put the data directly into your tax forms.  Other available formats in this option may be better for input to another tax event aggregation tool like Koinly.  NOTE: It is recommended to use CSV export from detailed transactions tab when exporting for tax aggregation tools.</li>
        <li>Future Options Coming THooon: Cost Basis cutoff Date, Exclude wallet Transfers for Cost Basis, Non-USD Fiat Currency Types, Multiple Wallet Selection.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Tax Report</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tax reporting requirements vary in different areas, but this report is meant to help you with accounting for things that are commonly required.</li>
        <li>The Capital Gains section will list detected NFT and Token Sales, and attempt to calculate the cost basis/gains for them where possible.</li>
        <li>The Income section will list detected events that are commonly categorized as income like bank interest and rewards.</li>
        <li>The Expenses section will list various costs you have incurred that may be helpful in filling gaps in your cost basis in some situations.</li>
        <li>If you see the warning icon <img src="{{ BASE_SCRIPT_URL }}static/images/alertred.png" style="height:16px;"/> in the costs column on the tax report, it means that Lila could not find a source for all of the cost basis of that item.  You can find more details in the CSV export to see how much it was partially accounted if any.</li>
        <li>Cost basis for NFT sales will be set by adding up any costs you have incurred for that NFT including Purchasing it, summoning it, or leveling it up.</li>
        <li>If cost basis for tokens sales is not found in the history of other swaps, other wallet transfers that are detected will be used to fill in remaining cost basis if possible.  Keep in mind that the price of those transferred tokens is calculated as of the time they were transferred to your address which is accurate if you purchased them that day.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The summary tab provides some summarized facts about your transactions.</li>
        <li>These items are just informational curiousities and not necessarily useful for tax accounting.</li>
        <li>Ever wonder how many bloaters you caught last month?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Transaction Report</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The transactions tab summarizes all activity for your wallet including things that are not included in the tax report.</li>
        <li>Heroes: All records related to heroes like buy/sell/hire, summon, and level up.</li>
        <li>Trader: Records of swaps make with trader or vendor in marketplace, or on Avalanche Pangolin.</li>
        <li>Liquidity: Records of swapping for LP seeds from the druid, and Entering and Withdrawing from liquidity pools in Serendale or on Pangolin.</li>
        <li>Gardens: Events of claiming rewards from your LP seeds in the gardens.</li>
        <li>Bank: Records of your bank deposits and withdrawals.</li>
        <li>Airdrop: Any Jewel airdrops you have received.</li>
        <li>Quests: All of your rewards from sending heroes on quests.</li>
        <li>Wallet: Any miscellanous transfers to/from your wallet to non-game related addresses.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Price Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fiat Values are calculated based on token price at the end of day when the event happened.</li>
        <li>Prices are sourced from Coin Gecko first if available, otherwise they are looked up from Defi Kingdoms graphql tokenDayData</li>
        <li>For some non-denomination items like some quest rewards, prices may be based on current price if historical price data is empty on the DFK graph.</li>
    </ul>
